Got it ‚Äì here‚Äôs a straightforward but detailed GDD for you based on your request.
Pixel art friendly, 20‚Äì30 min casual playthrough, farming with a twist, mini-clip era vibes.
I'll keep it punchy but fully detailed.

üåæ Game Design Document: "Harvest Rush"
1. Core Concept
You run a tiny, rapidly-decaying floating island farm.
The island shrinks every minute, forcing you to harvest crops and rebuild land fast.
You must balance farming, harvesting, and expanding to survive until the end (20‚Äì30 min).

2. Game Pillars
Farming + Land Management under pressure

Time-based urgency

Simple upgrades (no RPG/stat bloat)

3. Gameplay Loop
Plant crops ‚Üí Harvest ‚Üí Sell crops ‚Üí Buy land tiles ‚Üí Repeat.

If you run out of land, game over.

Game ends when you survive 30 minutes or reach a certain land mass size.

4. Controls
WASD: Move

E: Interact (plant/harvest/sell/buy land)

Mouse: None (keyboard only = mini-clip nostalgia)

5. Art Style
Very tiny sprites: 16x16 for characters, 8x8 or 16x16 for crops.

Simple palette:

Grass: #6ab04c

Dirt: #e67e22

Crop sprout: #27ae60

Full crop: #2ecc71

Water: #3498db

Player: #f6e58d (body) + #130f40 (outline)

Palette suggestion: DawnBringer 16 (perfect for simple pixel work).

6. Key Systems
a) Crop System
Stage	Description	Time
1	Seed	Instant
2	Sprout	30s
3	Harvestable	1 min

Crop grows automatically.

Must harvest manually.

b) Land System
Land tiles disappear over time (edge-first).

New tiles cost crops (e.g., 5 crops = 1 tile).

Tile placement is grid-locked.

c) Economy
1 crop = 1 currency.

New seed pack: 2 currency.

New land tile: 5 currency.

Tiny shops (simple popups).

d) Timer
Every 60 seconds:

Lose 5 random tiles from the island edge.

If player falls into water = instant game over.

7. Progression
Survive increasing speed of land loss:

Minutes 0‚Äì5: -5 tiles/min

Minutes 5‚Äì10: -7 tiles/min

Minutes 10‚Äì20: -10 tiles/min

Minutes 20‚Äì30: -12 tiles/min

Optional "prestige" after survival:

Hardcore mode: No new land purchase allowed.

8. UI
Top Left: Timer

Top Center: Land Remaining

Top Right: Crops in Inventory

Bottom Center (small): [E] Plant/Harvest/Sell/Expand

No complex menus ‚Äì everything handled via one action button.

9. Sound
8-bit style farm chiptune (~1-minute loop)

Sound effects:

Planting: "blip"

Harvesting: "plop"

Buying tile: "thunk"

Land falling into water: "splash"

10. Stretch Goals (optional if time)
Tiny animals wandering around (pure aesthetic, no gameplay).

Rare "golden crops" worth 5x.

Powerups: "Auto-harvest" 10s.

üìã Summary
Feature	Scope
Art	Tiny 16x16 or 8x8, DawnBringer16 palette
Gameplay Length	20‚Äì30 minutes
Depth	Farming, shrinking land, survival focus
Feel	Fast, tight, satisfying loop
Controls	Keyboard-only

Give me some references and examples of how this 16x16 pixel art would look

Here‚Äôs a fast set of visual references for what you should aim for:

üåæ Pixel Art Examples (16x16 style)
1. Simple Farming Sprites
Game: Forager

Example Spritesheet (Forager crops and land tiles)

Clean 16x16 crops and tools

Clear outlines, bright colors

Extremely readable even at tiny scale

2. Characters
Game: Celeste (PICO-8 version)

Celeste Classic Character (Madeline) PICO-8 version

Character is about 12x12 to 16x16

Very expressive with only 5‚Äì6 colors

Thick outlines make characters pop from background

3. General Look
DawnBringer 16 Palette examples:

DawnBringer 16 color palette full example

Pre-balanced for easy contrast and vibrant, readable sprites

Perfect for fast, clean art without worrying about clashing colors

4. Tiny Farming Game Examples
MiniFarms

MiniFarms Itch.io Screenshot

Pure farming game with small grid

Seeds, sprouts, mature crops using only 2‚Äì3 frames

Simple 1‚Äì2 pixel details to differentiate stages

üñåÔ∏è Quick Visual Idea
Imagine your sprites like this:

Grass tile: Solid green with 2-pixel lighter highlights

Dirt tile: Solid brown with a tiny pixel of pebble

Crop seedling: 2 green pixels

Crop mature: 4‚Äì5 green pixels (with a tiny flower maybe)

Player: 2x2 body block + 2-pixel head + 2-pixel feet

Summary Tip:
‚û°Ô∏è Think LEGO blocks but tiny. Big features with tiny amounts of detail. No complex shading.
‚û°Ô∏è Use outlines for anything important (player, crops).
‚û°Ô∏è Keep each sprite readable at 2x zoom (very important for casual browser game feel).
